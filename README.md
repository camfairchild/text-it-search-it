## How it Works
Text your search query to <number> and we will respond with a short list of results:  
  
    [0] Result 1
    [1] Result 2
    [2] Result 3
    [3] Result 4
    [4] Result 5
  
Text the number corresponding to the result you wish to learn more about and we will respond with more information.
